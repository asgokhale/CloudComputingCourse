This is the same example described on the Docker documentation pages.
See https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ for more details.

Start it as:

      docker-compose up

Note that the compose command will read the specifications provided in
the *.yml file and internally issue the docker build command to first build
an image, and then orchestrate the deployment of one or more docker
containers depending on what all is specific in the YAML file.  Dependencies
are specified in the accompanying requirements.txt file.

When it is time to stop, in another window, type

     docker-compose down

This command will orchestrate the tearing down of all the docker containers
started by the "up" command above.
