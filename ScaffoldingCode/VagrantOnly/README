As of Fall 2021 semester, the version of Vagrant is 2.2.18

General steps
----------------

Create an empty directory where you want to play with Vagrant

In that directory, run the following commands

vagrant init
        (this will create a skeleton vagrantfile, which we will modify)
        But note that it may overwrite the sample vagrantfile provided.
        So might want to rename it first.  Another sample vagrant file
        is provided that starts FreeBSD Unix in the virtual machine.

vagrant up
        (this will create a VM according to the specification)

vagrant provision
        (to be used if we keep changing the provisioning tasks but not the VM creation task)

vagrant ssh
        (to remote login into the VM we just created and provisioned)
        
vagrant destroy
        (to get rid of everything we did)
