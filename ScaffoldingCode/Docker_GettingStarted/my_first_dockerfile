# The FROM clause tells docker what underlying base to use. We use
# Ubuntu 18.04
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# install the following packages (replace it with your favorites)
#
# The RUN clause is used to execute different commands. Here we use
# the -y to supply the "yes" needed for apt-get to continue. Remember
# that the RUN command is non interactive.
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y g++ emacs subversion

# run bash as the final step of starting the container
CMD /bin/bash
