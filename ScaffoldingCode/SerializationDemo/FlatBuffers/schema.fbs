// IDL schema for the data type we will be transferring

// We have to define a namespace under which this schema gets
// translated to the programming language we are using.

// Since we are using Kafka in our assignments, I am going to call my
// namespace as MyKafkaTopic

namespace MyKafkaTopic;

// define the user-defined type we want to serialize
// This can be arbitrarily complex. Here we show a sample
// which is not overly complex but still showcases the features
//
// In your case this structure will be whatever is the data structure
// that holds the information that the producer will send to consumer

// The data structure is defined using the keyword table as shown. The
// variable name Topic is my choice.  Individual fields of the data structure
// use the form <variable name: data type>

table Topic
{
   seq_no: uint32;   // think of this as a seq num in a TCP segment
   ts: double;          // say this is the timestamp
   name: string;      // say this is some descriptive string
   data: [uint32];    // say this is some binary data
}

// indicate what is the top level structure from where the serialization starts.
// The reason we need this is because we may have a very complicated nested
// data structure and so we need to tell the compiler the starting point.

root_type Topic;
