In this directory we provide samples for different Kubernetes Workload Resources 
to realizing pods.  These include at a minimum Deployment, Job and Service.

See Self-Study slides for both these scenarios.

Deployment
--------------
In this directory, we use an nginx deployment YAML file from the Kubernetes.io
distribution. We show a 3-replica deployment on our 2-node cluster. We then show
how to convert it into a service.  We then delete this service and deployment.


Job
----
In this directory, we use a home-grown matrix inverse code and the associated
Docker container in which it runs as a Job type pod managed by Kubernetes.

Since our docker image for this matrix inverse program is not available in hub.docker.com,
we either need to create a private registry from where the Kuberenetes system can find
it, or else we must manually build the image and have it available in the cache of every
worker node.  We will use the latter approach.

So first build the docker image for each worker machine in our cluster using the
following command:

docker build -f dockerfile -t my-matrixinv .

where, I am providing a tag called my-matrixinv. You can use something else but
make sure to use that in the YAML file.

We then show how to use kubectl CLI commands to run against the matrix inverse
container inside a pod.
