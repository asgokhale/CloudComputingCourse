In this directory we use our matrix inverse program and a corresponding
dockerfile to build the image.

There are 4 YAML files from which we attempt to create a working pod.
(1) matinv-job_wMistake.yaml:
     Although syntactically correct, this will not help to create the pod because
     the image is cached locally on master and not available on hub; and so the
     worker cannot find it. This happens because the policy is to always pull.

(2) matinv-job_wLocalImage.yaml:
     Here we make the imagePullPolicy as never. So this means that the node must be
     able to find the image pre-cached in its cache. For this to work, you must build the
     dockerfile on each worker machine you have, which is not a scalable task as the
     number of machines and number of images managed grows.

(3) matinv-job_wRegistryMistake.yaml:
     Here we specify the private registry's IP address but it is localhost:5000.  If we
     keep the imagePullPolicy to Never, then the worker will try to look into its own
     localhost:5000 and does not find one unless we degenerate to case #2 by
     creating local private registries and building images and pushing them locally.
     As such this will be even more work than #2.  Even if we say the policy is Always,
     it will try to pull from localhost:5000, which is the same case as finding locally.
     Either way, things fail.

(4) matinv-job_wCorrectRegistry.yaml:
     Here we make the imagePullPolicy as Always.  Moreover, and more importantly,
     we specify the IP address of the master private registry which is holding all our
     private images. So as long as the IP address is reachable, we are in good shape.
