# This playbook will install python on our Cloud VM
# Python is needed to run Ansible.  Python is the first thing we need.
# But if Python doesn't exist on the machine, then how can ansible
# execute. This is a chicken-and-egg problem. To overcome this
# Ansible supports "pre_tasks" which can be raw.
#
- hosts: MyChameleonVMs       # my list of VMs on chosen cloud
  remote_user:  cc        # remote user is cc but change as appropriate
  become: yes               # run as sudo
  gather_facts: no        # do not gather facts from remote machine
  collections:   # this is new starting with Ansible 2.9 (akin to importing package)
    - openstack.cloud
  pre_tasks:       # Task is something a playbook is supposed
                            # to execute. Tasks contain actions which
                            # are modules and their arguments
    - name: 'install python3'     # always a good practice to name tasks
      raw: apt-get install -y python3    # raw module does not need
                                                                  # python on remote side
