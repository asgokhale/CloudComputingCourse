# Author: Aniruddha Gokhale

#
# This playbook will remove specified packages on cloud VM
# Our cloud can be Horizon Cloud VM or Chameleon VMs or AWS VMs
- hosts: MyChameleonVMs  # machines on whom the action is performed
  remote_user:  cc    # change username depending on what it is on the cloud
  collections:   # this is new starting with Ansible 2.9 (akin to importing package)
    - openstack.cloud

  tasks:
  - name: Remove subversion (that we installed using the other playbook)
    apt: name=subversion state=absent purge=yes
                     # by making state=absent, we imply remove
                     # by saying purge=yes, all config files are removed 
    become: yes     # run with "sudo" privileges
